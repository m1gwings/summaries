## Summary

The <u>first part</u> of the article is about the name "computer science" and some of its flaws. The author cites a definition of science from Webster: "a branch of study concerned with the observation and classification of facts, especially with the establishment and quantitative formulation of verifiable general laws". He highlights that **science is concerned with the <u>discovery</u>** of facts and laws. According to the author, the discipline that we call computer science, being focused with _making things_, be they computers, algorithms, or software systems, is more an **engineering discipline**. Indeed, the distinction between scientific and engineering disciplines is not much in the _activities_, but rather in the _purposes_. "<u>The scientist _builds in order to study_; the engineer _studies in order to build_</u>". The difference with other engineering disciplines is that, in computer science, much of the product is intangible, for this reason, it has also be defined "the engineering of abstract objects". Even in the process of building a computer, the computer scientist designs only the abstract properties.
According to the author, the **misnaming** of the discipline leads to several **unhappy trends**:
- First, it implies that computer scientists accept a perceived order that places natural scientists above engineers and that they seek to appropriate the higher station for themselves.
- Second, sciences legitimately take the discovery of facts and laws as a proper end in itself. A new fact, a new law is an accomplishment worthy of publication. If computer scientists confuse themselves with scientists, they come to take the invention (and publication) of endless varieties of computers, algorithms, and languages as a proper end, while they should regard their artifacts as tools and value them according to their usefulness and cost.
- Third, computer scientists tend to forget their users and their real problems, climbing into ivory towers to dissect tractable abstractions of those problems, abstractions that may have left behind the essence of the real problem.
- Fourth, computer scientists honor the more mathematical, abstract, and "scientific" parts of the subject more, and the practical parts less, misdirecting young and brilliant minds away from a body of challenging and important problems; depriving these problems of the powerful attacks they deserve.


The <u>second part</u> of the article frames the role of the computer scientist as a _toolsmith_.
