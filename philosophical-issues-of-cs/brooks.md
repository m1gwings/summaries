## Summary

The <u>first part</u> of the article is about the name "computer science" and some of its flaws. The author cites a definition of science from Webster: "a branch of study concerned with the observation and classification of facts, especially with the establishment and quantitative formulation of verifiable general laws". He highlights that **science is concerned with the <u>discovery</u>** of facts and laws. According to the author, the discipline that we call computer science, being focused with _making things_, be they computers, algorithms, or software systems, is more an **engineering discipline**. Indeed, the distinction between scientific and engineering disciplines is not much in the _activities_, but rather in the _purposes_. "<u>The scientist _builds in order to study_; the engineer _studies in order to build_</u>". The difference with other engineering disciplines is that, in computer science, much of the product is intangible, for this reason, it has also be defined "the engineering of abstract objects". Even in the process of building a computer, the computer scientist designs only the abstract properties.
According to the author, the **misnaming** of the discipline leads to several **unhappy trends**:
- First, it implies that computer scientists accept a perceived order that places natural scientists above engineers and that they seek to appropriate the higher station for themselves.
- Second, sciences legitimately take the discovery of facts and laws as a proper end in itself. A new fact, a new law is an accomplishment worthy of publication. If computer scientists confuse themselves with scientists, they come to take the invention (and publication) of endless varieties of computers, algorithms, and languages as a proper end, while they should regard their artifacts as tools and value them according to their usefulness and cost.
- Third, computer scientists tend to forget their users and their real problems, climbing into ivory towers to dissect tractable abstractions of those problems, abstractions that may have left behind the essence of the real problem.
- Fourth, computer scientists honor the more mathematical, abstract, and "scientific" parts of the subject more, and the practical parts less, misdirecting young and brilliant minds away from a body of challenging and important problems; depriving these problems of the powerful attacks they deserve.

Regarding the "computer" part of the name, the author thinks that this is right. Indeed, "the computer enables software to handle a world of complexity not previously accessible to those limited to hand techniques".

The <u>second part</u> of the article regards the evolution of artificial intelligence. At the beginning of the development of the field, "the practice was primitive", and it was mostly rhetoric: "we will make machines that think; we will make giant brains". With sufficient time and effort, the field produced marvelous artifacts like robots that can recognize visual patterns and spoken language. The field received tremendous national investment from the United States. According to the author, too much "compared to other promising opportunities". But, more serious than the diversion of public funds, the author highlights the problem of the diversion of the very best computer science minds of a generation, and much of the effort of the very best academic laboratories.
The by-products of this research effort have been impressive: new data-structures and ways of representing knowledge, programming languages, families of computers. But the author remarks that, for the main objectives, the field has accomplished surprisingly little for the time and investment. At one time it looked as if at least the field of expert systems would prove a triumph. Unfortunately these systems have been recognized hard to scale since they become really cumbersome to manage when the number of rules reaches the order of thousands. According to the author, the original goals of AI sent the discipline in the wrong direction. The author states that, in his opinion, _Intelligence Amplifying_ (IA) systems can, at any given level of available systems technology, beat AI systems. That is, a machine _and_ a mind, can beat a mind-imitating machine working by itself.

The <u>third part</u> of the article frames the role of the computer scientist as a _toolsmith_. First of all, the author remarks the _gift of sub-creation_: "the ability and the call to create are given to us to enrich our lives and to enable us to enrich each other". Then the author argues why it is important for a computer scientist to regard himself as a toolsmith. He starts by stating the following thesis: "_hitching our reasearch to someone else's driving problems, and solving those problems on the owners' terms, leads us to richer computer science research_". Indeed, according to the author, this has the following benefits:
- It aims computer scientists at relevant problems, not just exercises or toy-scale problems.
- It keeps computer scientists honest about success and failure.
- It makes computer scientists face the _whole_ problem, not just the easy or mathematical parts.
- Facing the whole problem in turn forces computer scientists to learn or develop new computer science, often in areas that otherwise would never have been addressed.
- It is fun.

Finally, the author ends the part by stating the criteria of success of a tool produced by a computer scientist.
- It must be so _easy_ that a full professor _can use_ it.
- It must be so _productive_ that a full professor _will use_ it.

Indeed, the tool-building collaborations are a success when the senior collaborating scientists use the tools for their personal work. "Ph.D. student can and will use any crummy tools that inch their theses along".
