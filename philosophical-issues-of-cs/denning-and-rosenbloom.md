# Summary of "Computing: The Fourth Great Domain of Science"

The article tries to answer to the following question: "can _computer science_ rightfully claim a place at the **table of science**?".

To answer this question, the authors start by studying the main characteristics of the disciplines commonly accepted as sciences, i.e., the _acknowledged sciences_.
The acknowledged **sciences** are grouped into **three great domains**:
- **physical**,
- **life**,
- and **social**.

The _physical_ sciences focus on physical phenomena, especially materials, energy, electromagnetism, etc..
The _life_ sciences focus on living things, especially species, metabolism, reproduction, and evolution.
The _social_ sciences focus on human behavior, mind, economic, and social interactions.

These domains share **three common features**:
- their **foci** are _distinctive phenomena_ <u>important</u> in _all other scientific disciplines_;
- their disciplines have rich sets of **structures** and **processes** that _evolve together through constant interaction_;
- their **influence** is _extensive_ touching all parts of life.

The domain of sciences are usually represented through hierarchical taxonomies. It is easy to craft a tree hierarchy representing all the parent and child relationships among fields, in the domain. However, this representation has the issue of not capturing the interactions among the different fields.
Indeed, two out of the three criteria listed earlier involve interactions, either among structures and processes or among domains. These interactions generate the essential richness of science.

More in detail, scientific fields affect each other in _two ways_: _implementation_ and _interaction_. A combination of existing things **implements** a phenomenon by generating the intended behaviors of the phenomenon. **Interaction** occurs when two phenomena influence each other.

Observe that computing, despite not fitting nicely in any of the above domains, has all the three distinctive features which characterize them.

In particular:
- it has a distinctive focus: **computation**, which we define as <u>_transformations of representations_</u>, and **information processes**;
- its constituent fields (computer science, informatics, information technology, computer engineering, software engineering, and information systems) and its structures and processes are in continuous interaction;
- its influence is pervasive, reaching deep into people's lives and work.

Finally, computing has large slices that qualify as science, engineering, and mathematics. But no one of those slices tells the whole story of the field.

## Comment

It is not sufficient to show that the elements of a group have some properties and that another element has the same properties to argue that the other element belongs to the group. We should instead give a characterization of the group by listing the properties necessary and sufficient for an element to belong to the group and then show that a certain element enjoys such properties. In the specific case which is treated in the article, in my opinion, it would have been better to give a definition of what is science and show that computing satisfies the required properties. In particular there should have been a focus on the scientific method and how this is implemented in computing disciplines.
